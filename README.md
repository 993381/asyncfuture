## AsyncFuture - Enhance QFuture for asynchronous programming

QFuture represents the result of an asynchronous computation. It is a powerful component for multi-thread programming. But its usage is limited to the result of threads. And QtConcurrent only provides a MapReduce usage model that may not fit your usage. Morever, it doesn't work with the asynchronous signal emitted by QObject. And it is a bit trouble to setup the listener function via QFutureWatcher.

AsyncFuture is designed to enhance the function to offer a better way to use it for asynchronous programming. This project is inspired by AsynQt and RxCpp.

Features
========

**1. Convert a signal from QObject into a QFuture object**

```c++

#include "asyncfuture.h"
using namespace AsyncFuture;

// Convert a signal from QObject into a QFuture object

QFuture<void> future = observe(timer,
                               &QTimer::timeout).future();

/* Listen from the future without using QFutureWatcher<T>*/
observe(future).subscribe([]() {
    // onCompleted. It is invoked when the observed future is finished successfully
    qDebug() << "onCompleted";
},[]() {
    // onCanceled
    qDebug() << "onCancel";
});

/* It is chainable. Listen from a timeout signal only once */
observe(timer, &QTimer::timeout).subscribe([=]() { /*â€¦*/ });
```

**2. Combine multiple futures with different type into a single future object**

```c++
/* Combine multiple futures with different type into a single future */

QFuture<QImage> f1 = QtConcurrent::run(readImage, QString("image.jpg"));

QFuture<void> f2 = observe(timer, &QTimer::timeout).future();

(combine() << f1 << f2).subscribe([](QVariantList result){
    // Read an image
    // result[0] = QImage
    qDebug() << result;
});
```

**3. Advanced multi-threading model**

```c++
/* Start a thread and process its result in main thread */

QFuture<QImage> reading = QtConcurrent::run(readImage, QString("image.jpg"));

QFuture<bool> validating = observe(reading).context(contextObject, validator).future();

    // Read image by a thread, when it is ready, run the validator function
    // in the thread of the contextObject(e.g main thread)
    // And it return another QFuture to represent the final result.

/* Start a thread and process its result in main thread, then start another thread. */

QFuture<int> f1 = QtConcurrent::mapped(input, mapFunc);

QFuture<int> f2 = observe(f1).context(contextObject, [=](QFuture<int> future) {
    // You may use QFuture as the input argument of your callback function
    // It will be set to the observed future object. So that you may obtain
    // the value of results()

    qDebug() << future.results();

    // Return another QFuture is possible.
    return QtConcurrent::run(reducerFunc, future.results());
}).future();

// f2 is constructed before the QtConcurrent::run statement
// But its value is equal to the result of reducerFunc

```
